# News Site

The assignment was to make a news-site and learn the basic structure of html, css, css flexbox, css grid and media queries (mobile first).


## The problem

"Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use?"

IÂ´m a total code-beginner so it was overwhelming learning all the settings with vscode+the terminal commands+github. I decided to make a lot of test sites so that I would learn to use the terminal etc.
I started the project by reading and watching all the material on the pre-course site. It was quite a lot of information and very confusing so I started watching youtube video tutorials on different solutions and then copying them to vscode so I would start understanding everything with html, css, flexbox, grid, mediaqueries. And also to exercise the whole part with the vscode terminal + github + netlify. So I made several test-sites and tried out different ways to see how it looks on desktop+tablet+mobile. I made a simple design on paper because I felt I didnt want to start with figma yet, it was too much to handle at that point. I studied the concept "mobile-first" and made some mistakes in the test sites.
I first used grid on the entire page but then realized I must use flexbox also, so I made the header and navbar with flexbox and the rest with grid. 
"My best friend" through this experience was w3schools.com... I had like 20tabs open every day on my browser!
In the end I made one stretch goal: Add a box-shadow to the photos.


"If you had more time, what would be next?"

The "main" section was ugly, I struggled with it alot (media queries part and grid) and gave up in the end.
SO I would work on the main section aka big news section more.
I would also:
Align the cards to the centre of the page.
Add some CSS animations to your project.
