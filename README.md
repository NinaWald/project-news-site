# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

The assignment was to make a news-site and learn the basic structure of html, css, css flexbox, css grid and media queries.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started the project by reading and watching all the material on the pre-course site. It was quote alot and very confusing so I started watching youtube video tutorials on different solutions and then copying them to vscode so I would start understanding everything with html, css, flexbox, grid, mediaqueries. And also to exercise the whole part with the vscode terminal + github + netlify. So I made several test-sites and tried out different ways to see how it looks on desktop+tablet+mobile. I made a simple design on paper because I felt I didnt want to start with figma yet, it was too much to handle at that point.
I first used grid on the entire page but then realized I must use flexbox also, so I made the header with navbar with flexbox and the rest with grid. 
My best friend through this experience was w3schools.com... I had like 20tabs open every day on my browser.
