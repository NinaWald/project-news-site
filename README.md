# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

The assignment was to make a news-site and learn the basic structure of html, css, css flexbox, css grid and media queries.

## The problem

"Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? "

I´m a total code-beginner so it was overwhelming learning all the settings with vscode+the terminal commands+github. I decided to make alot of test sites so that I would learn to use the terminal etc.
I started the project by reading and watching all the material on the pre-course site. It was quote alot and very confusing so I started watching youtube video tutorials on different solutions and then copying them to vscode so I would start understanding everything with html, css, flexbox, grid, mediaqueries. And also to exercise the whole part with the vscode terminal + github + netlify. So I made several test-sites and tried out different ways to see how it looks on desktop+tablet+mobile. I made a simple design on paper because I felt I didnt want to start with figma yet, it was too much to handle at that point.
I first used grid on the entire page but then realized I must use flexbox also, so I made the header with navbar with flexbox and the rest with grid. 
My best friend through this experience was w3schools.com... I had like 20tabs open every day on my browser.

I really loved that it was so creative to make a website! I´m really a creative person and I love to work with colours and shapes. 

"If you had more time, what would be next?"
The "main" section was not really to my satisfaction, I struggled with it alot and gave up in the end. The text area is not pretty.
